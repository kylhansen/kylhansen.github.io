<h1>My Philosophy of Education</h1>
<div class="posts">
    <p>
    Although I hope to flesh this page out more in the future, I wanted to put something down here to make my own philosophy of education clear to everyone who has me as a TA.

        In high school, I had a teacher who constantly told our class that "All education is self-education." (I later learned that this is a quote by someone named Louis L'Amour, about whom I know absolutely nothing.) This quote, I think, accurately sums up what I believe about education as a whole. Your education can not be sustained entirely by outside forces. Eventually, you will have to take charge of your own education.

        I've learned over the past few years how easy it is to blame external circumstances for difficulties in learning: a bad professor, being sick on the day of an exam, a family emergency, etc.. I agree that these are <em>challenges</em> to one's education, but I also believe that they are not the defining factor in one's education. Ultimately, the responsibility for getting a good education rests on the students themselves: it's up to the student to ask questions about things they don't understand; it's up to the student to seek out new questions to ask; it's up to the student to learn how to learn, and to start learning.

        That being said, it is also the role of the teacher to help on that learning journey. After all, it's the job of the teacher to ask questions of the student, to guide them in answering their questions, and to help them on the path of learning. As someone who is currently both a student and a teacher, I hope that I embody both of these roles to the fullest of my ability in the coming years.
