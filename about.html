    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I grew up in Newberg, Oregon, where I attended high school, played water polo, sang in choir, and a variety of other things. I graduated from Westmont College in 2019 with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I currently live in Santa Barbara, and am in my first year as a graduate student in Mathematics at UCSB. My office is located in South Hall, room 6431V, and my office hours are Mondays from 11-12. I am also in the Math Lab on Thursdays from 1-3.</p>
