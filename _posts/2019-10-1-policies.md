# Policies, Boundaries, and Expectations

Any healthy relationship has well-defined boundaries and expectations. Any well-structured course has well-defined policies as well. In addition to the items listed in the main instructor's syllabus, I have my own policies, boundaries, and expectations which I have started to list here. This list is subject to change as I become more experienced as a TA.

## Policies

1. Aside from emergencies, if an academic conflict arises which prevents the student from attending discussion section, __24 hours notice__ must be provided in order to find an appropriate solution to the conflict.
2. Each quarter, one unexcused absence from section may be made up by obtaining a copy of the work done in class and attending office hours and/or Math Lab when I am present to discuss the material. It is the responsibility of __the student__ to contact me within 1 week about scheduling a time to make up the section.
3. If I notice a student is actively disengaged from section (i.e. continually texting/playing on phone, distracting other students, disrupting the class), I may ask the student to leave the room, and will count this as an unexcused absence for the day.

## Boundaries

1. I will not respond to emails between 9pm and 9am. I will attempt to respond to all emails within 24 hours. If I do not, please feel free to send me a follow-up after 24 hours.
2. My policies remain unchanged during the weeks of midterms and exams. (This means if you have a question about something at 10pm on Thursday night with an exam on Friday at 9am, you should not expect an answer before your exam begins.)

## Expectations

1. Discussion sections are called "discussion" sections for a reason. I expect students to discuss mathematics, either with me or with their fellow students, during this time.
2. I expect students to take responsibility for their own learning, to collaborate with others, but to do so only when allowed. I expect students to know the difference between appropriate collaboration and cheating.
3. Although we would like to live in a world without bias and discrimination, I expect some level of these to creep into the sections, both by myself and by the students. I expect, then, that each of us holds the other accountable for addressing such issues when noticed, and that each of us accepts correction with humility.
4. On a similar note, I expect students to make mistakes, and I expect that I will make plenty of mistakes myself. Because of this, I expect to use mistakes as learning moments--both for myself, and for the students.
5. Finally, I expect students to use my office hours and the Math Lab! Seriously, come on by. Even if it isn't something related to math, my office hours are for you to visit me (though I'll have to prioritize math-related visits).
